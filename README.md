# mjl_portfolio

This assignment was to create a web-based portfolio to "showcase...skills and talents to employers." To create this, I used many of the new techniques and tools we have been studying in Bootcamp (particularly in the second week) - e.g., flexboxes, media queries, and CSS variables. 

As predicted in the README.md for this assignment, I do not have enough web applications to showcase at this point, so the portfolio has a couple of placholders for future projects, and the projects that it does showcase will be replaced in the future by more substantial and compelling full-stack web projects.

## Known issues

* The graphic design needs a lot of improvement. I did not focus on the graphic design for this assigment because I wanted to devote most of my time to the functionality (since that was the theme of week 2's studies). Improvements are needed for font, color, placement, and graphics -  e.g., large blocks of color should be replaced by graphics.
* The functionality is a bit rough, particularly with smaller screen sizes. I believe this is due to an overly complicated and fragile architecture. The flexbox-within-a-flexbox design proved too complicated. Perhaps it has the potential to make a very responsive design, but I didn't have time (and I spent a lot of time on this) to really get it working. Every added element seemed to break the design at some fundamental level, so I think it's basically flawed. Also, I just don't understand how to integrate graphics well (definitly an area for future research). In the office hours that either preceded or followed the 4/3/21 class session, a discussion between a TA and one of the students made it clear that the better option would have been to put the "About Me", "Work", etc., headings in an Aside section. (I had rejected this idea early on because I didn't think it would be suitable to really small screens.)
* CSS code is confusing. The overly complex structure lead to overly complex and obscure CSS styles. Far from being self documenting, the code became more unclear as I implemented workarounds to the issues that seemed to crop up at every stage. 
* The "About me" text is still very centered on my current position as an information developer. Hopefully, as the bootcamp progresses, I can shift that emphasis toward full-stack developer.
